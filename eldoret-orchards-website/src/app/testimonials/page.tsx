    title: 'From Empty Land to Thriving Orchard',
    farmer: 'Robert Kiptanui',
    location: 'Nandi Hills',
    image: '/images/Start Citriculture3.jpg',
    content: `
      <p>Robert had 2 acres of unused land that wasn't suitable for traditional crops due to the sloping terrain. In 2018, he decided to plant 200 apple seedlings from Eldoret Orchards, specifically choosing the Anna and Dorsett Golden varieties that are well-suited to his elevation of 2100m above sea level.</p>
      
      <p>"The first year was about establishing the trees and ensuring proper care," Robert recalls. "The team from Eldoret Orchards visited twice to provide guidance on pruning and fertilization."</p>
      
      <p>By the third year, Robert's orchard began producing marketable fruits. Today, he harvests approximately 3,000kg of apples annually, which he sells to local markets and supermarkets in Eldoret town.</p>
      
      <p>"What began as an experiment has become my main source of income," says Robert. "The initial investment has paid off many times over, and the demand for locally grown apples continues to exceed my supply."</p>

    title: 'School Project Becomes Community Resource',
    farmer: 'Eldoret Technical Institute',
    location: 'Uasin Gishu County',
    image: '/images/Sassy Brazilian Cherry.jpg',
    content: `
      <p>In 2019, Eldoret Technical Institute started an agricultural training program with a diverse orchard of 50 fruit trees from Eldoret Orchards, including citrus, apple, and avocado varieties.</p>
      
      <p>"Our goal was to create a living laboratory for our students," explains Principal Janet Kosgei. "What we didn't expect was how quickly it would become a resource for the entire community."</p>
      
      <p>The institute now runs regular workshops for local farmers, using their mature trees as demonstration models. They've expanded to include a small nursery where they propagate seedlings under the guidance of Eldoret Orchards' experts.</p>
      
      <p>"We've trained over 300 farmers in the past two years," Janet notes. "Many have gone on to establish successful orchards of their own, creating a multiplier effect from our initial investment."</p>

    title: 'Papaya Farming Transforms Family&apos;s Fortunes',
    farmer: 'The Mutai Family',
    location: 'Kitale',
    image: '/images/When papaya decides.jpg',
    content: `
      <p>When drought affected their maize farm three years in a row, the Mutai family decided to diversify with papaya farming using PY F1 Hybrid seedlings from Eldoret Orchards.</p>
      
      <p>"We started with just half an acre as a trial," explains Peter Mutai. "The trees began bearing fruit within 9 months, and we were harvesting twice a week."</p>
      
      <p>The quick returns and consistent income prompted the family to expand to 2 acres of papaya cultivation. They now supply fruits to hotels in Kitale and Eldoret, as well as to traders who export to South Sudan.</p>
      
      <p>"The beauty of papaya is that it produces year-round," says Peter's wife, Mercy. "This has given us consistent cash flow unlike seasonal crops, allowing us to pay school fees without taking loans."</p>
      
      <p>The family has now installed drip irrigation and is experimenting with inter-cropping vegetables between the papaya trees to maximize land use.</p>
